Some tools for trading steam cards at http://steam.cards (aka
steamcardexchange.net).

The first tool is a Chromium extension.  This works in both Chromium,
Chrome, and Opera (and possibly even in Vivaldi and whatnot).

Install the extension:
 1. Go to about://extensions in your browser.
 2. Enter developer mode by pressing the button marked Developer mode
 3. Press Load unpacked extension and navigate to the chromium_extension folder

Now that you visit http://www.steamcardexchange.net/index.php?inventory
you will notice a new column appearing to the far right.  The "Total" column
represents the cost in credits needed to buy a whole set, and is calculated
by taking the cost for one card (noted in the "Worth" column) times the
number of card in the set.

Also, if you have connected your page to your steam account, the extension
will check your inventory each time you visit the inventory of a specific game.
For example, if you have 2 CS:GO cards, and visit
http://www.steamcardexchange.net/index.php?inventorygame-appid-730
the number of cards in your inventory will be displayed above the
corresponding card on the page.
Note that this requires you to be logged in on the Steam Card Exchange page
in order to work.


Included is also a node server with two services running, one
for searching through the inventory of the trading bot and monitors
the inventory status of the cards the user is missing, and another
that looks through a users inventory and lists the prices of cards
that the user might be interesting in trading away.

Example:
 1. Start the server by running:
      node counter.js
 2. Visit http://localhost:8080/17710_2,317710_3,284770_6,212680_5
    Note that the ID:s are separated by commas.
    You can find the ID of a specific card by looking at the URL for the
    Quick-Trade button on http://steam.cards.
  or
    Visit http://localhost:8081/[steam_id]
    You can get your steam_id by looking at the url of your steam profile page
    at http://steamcommunity.com/
 3. The page will fill up as the search goes on.  The API is limited to
    2500 items per lookup, so it might have to go through a few pages
    before displaying the results.
 4. The result is printed out at the bottom of the page.
 5. Happy trading!
