Some tools for trading steam cards at http://steam.cards (aka
steamcardexchange.net).  There's currently two services running, one
for searching through the inventory of the trading bot and monitors
the inventory status of the cards the user is missing, and another
that looks through a users own inventory and lists the prices of cards
that the user might be interesting in trading away.

Example:
 1. Start the server by runnig:
      node counter.js
 2. Visit http://localhost:8080/17710_2,317710_3,284770_6,212680_5
    Note that the ID:s are separated by commas.
    You can find the ID of a specific card by looking at the URL for the
    Quick-Trade button on http://steam.cards.
  or
    Visit http://localhost:8081/[steam_id]
    You can get your steam_id by looking at the url of your steam profile page
    at http://steamcommunity.com/
 3. The page will fill up as the search goes on.  The API is limited to
    2500 items per lookup, so it will have to go through a few pages
    before displaying the results.
 4. The result is printed out at the bottom of the page.
 5. Happy trading!
