This tool searches through the inventory of http://steam.cards and
counts the number of cards that matches the users search terms.

Right now, it's only possible to search by card id.

Example:
 1. Start the server by runnig:
      node counter.js
 2. Visit http://localhost:8080/17710_2,317710_3,284770_6,212680_5
    Note that the ID:s are separated by commas.
    You can find the ID of a specific card by looking at the URL for the
    Quick-Trade button on http://steam.cards.
 3. The page will fill up as the search goes on.  The API is limited to
    2500 items per lookup, so it will have to go through a few pages
    before displaying the results.
 4. The result is printed out at the bottom of the page.
 5. Happy trading!
